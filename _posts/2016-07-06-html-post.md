<html> Tag

There are three basic parts of an HTML document. The <html> tag signifies that the document will contain html code. The entire document is contained between <html> and </html>

<head> Tag

The next part of the document contains the <head> tag. The <head> tag contains information about the page but does not display on a web browser page. This section usually contains the <title> tag which displays the name of the page on the menu tab of a web browser. This section can also contains the <link> tag which links to a .css file that can provide style and formatting for a web page. The end of this section is closed with a </head> tag.

<body> Tag

The last section of a HTML document is the <body>. The content of the page is contained in this section. There are many tags that can be used in this section. <h1> to <h6> are headlines that decrease in font size from one to six. The <p> is the start of a new paragraph. Ordered lists can be created using <ol> and unordered lists use <ul>. The elements within these lists are signified using <li>. The <div> tag is used for a division in the document. This is helpful when formatting and styling the page. Tables can be created using <table>, hyperlinks use <a> tags, and images use <img>. There are countless other examples that can be viewed here.
